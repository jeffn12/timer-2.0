# Timer 2.0

This is a timer application based on the Pomodoro Technique. The [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) consists of cycles of work time and short breaks, until a certain number of cycles has been complete. Then, a slightly longer break is taken before starting the process over again.

   ```
1. install dependencies:
